# Phyllotaxis and Machine Learning
The goal for this project is to simulate a growing plant (as seen from above), to let it "choose" where it places its new leaves, and to evaluate it by how much surface area is visible to the sun over time as the leaves grow and inevitably overshadow one another. Once we have this model, we should be able to run it through a neural network and hopefully vindicate Nature's conclusion that each new leaf should rotate by the [golden angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_angle).
